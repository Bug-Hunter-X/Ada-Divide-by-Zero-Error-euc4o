# Ada Divide by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Ada: division by zero.  The example code includes a simple procedure that attempts to divide an integer by zero. This results in a runtime error that needs to be handled properly to prevent application crashes. The solution showcases exception handling to gracefully deal with such situations.

## Running the Code

The code can be compiled and run using an Ada compiler (like GNAT). The `bug.ada` file shows the error and `bugSolution.ada` shows the solution.
